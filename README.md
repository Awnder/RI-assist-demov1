# 💬 R&I Assistant Chatbot (RIA)

## Why RIA?

❓Other chatbots (like 🤖 ChatGPT) are not able to give assistance about Saddleback-specific questions such as how we say our scrum status, details on report standards and guidelines, or information on the data dictionary.

❗This is where **RIA** (*R*&*I* *A*ssistant) comes in - armed with knowledge about Saddleback-specific standards, designs, and Github code, RIA provides volunteers and interns with support, guidance, and answers for common tasks and problems.

## How to use RIA?
